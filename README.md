# 3DRaycast
A 3D Raycasting Engine (fork of https://github.com/name-here/3DRaycast)

## TODO
[ ]Work on [TODO](TODO.md)


## How to install
* Need SDL2 library, [download either runtime or development SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and put it into /Library/Frameworks. (Installer says it will work in ~/Library/Frameworks, too. We didn't have such a folder on our osX 10.13.6 machine, so we made one.)

"Though these are OpenSceneGraph centric, the same exact concepts apply to	SDL, thus the videos are recommended for everybody getting started with	developing on Mac OS X. (You can skim over the PlugIns stuff since SDLdoesn't have any PlugIns to worry about.)"
